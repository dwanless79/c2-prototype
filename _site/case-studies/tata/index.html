<h2 id="company-profile">Company profile</h2>

<p>Serving some of the most demanding markets in the world, Tata Steel is Europe’s second largest steel manufacturer, with steelmaking facilities in the UK and the Netherlands, plus operations across mainland Europe. Tata Steel employs approximately 25,000 employees and operates in the automotive, energy and power, lifting and excavating, construction, packaging and rail markets.</p>

<p>The steel giant develops and produces steel for a whole spectrum of markets, which includes the automotive and transport industries, construction, consumer packaging and general industry.</p>

<h2 id="business-challenges">Business Challenges</h2>

<p>Tata Steel recognised the need to move to SharePoint Online following a strategic Intranet review in 2013 when it considered the limitations of its legacy Intranet. It emerged that a new Intranet would need to be implemented quickly, have multi-lingual &amp; responsive capabilities and be cost effective. It would need to also allow Tata Steel’s 25,000 strong workforce to work better together without being limited to their location whilst achieving improved operational efficiencies.</p>

<p>Cost and speed of delivery were a key driver for Tata Steel’s choice of provider. Tata Steel were also concerned about the internal effort which may be required to turn a ‘vanilla’ SharePoint Online into a fully featured Intranet. The incumbent Intranet was overly complex and difficult to use and edit, which created additional administrative overheads.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Cloud2’s hadron 8020 was selected as the solution of choice for many reasons. In addition to the solution being competitively priced, Tata Steel were impressed with the consultative support they received from Cloud2 during the selection process. Chris Sparrow, Senior Business Analyst, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We selected Hadron 8020 because it was a clear fit with our requirements. Hadron will help develop staff engagement and enable us to drive usage of the Intranet into those parts of the organisation where we have previously struggled.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hadron 8020 satisfied the appetites of both technical and business leaders within Tata Steel with its ability to be configured with a multi-lingual and multi-territory framework. Tata Steel are satisfied that they will be receiving an enterprise level Intranet, which is preconfigured and ready for use. Hadron 8020 will help Tata Steel move forward quickly and demonstrate its value to the business at the same time by being usable, adaptable and workable by staff.</p>

<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>

<p>Tata Steel quickly realised the potential in Hadron 8020 to enable employees to have full access from their personal devices while on the move, as well as via corporate PCs at their work stations. This would especially benefit those workers who are not desk based, or are mobile workers. Further benefits to be realised include:</p>

<p><strong>Standardisation:</strong> Hadron 8020 has a well-developed information architecture which allows the standardisation of information across the whole business. This will improve productivity by helping people find the right information first time.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Hadron 8020 allows Tata Steel to present their information in a consistent manner, with a managed approach to branding and navigation across SharePoint Online.</p>

<p><strong>Further Developments:</strong> By developing an Intranet built on the Hadron platform, this will assist in the development of further Office 365 Services across the Tata Steel organisation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am particularly excited that the Hadron deployment will be completed within three months, as opposed to the 24 months it can typically take. Not only have Cloud2 provided the multi-territory Intranet that we needed, what struck us is that it’s not just a product you receive, it’s a complete enterprise Intranet solution.”</p>
