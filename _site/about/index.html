<p>Admittedly, it’s a mouthful. But all it really means is we work with you to ensure the digital solutions (or, as we call them, digital workspaces) you roll out are</p>

<ul>
  <li>thought through</li>
  <li>introduced smoothly</li>
  <li>adopted by staff</li>
  <li>and deliver a substantial ROI</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a vision to be the leading enabler in digital transformation. And, by supporting you through every step of the digital transformation process, we’re confident we’ll achieve our goal.</p>

And they saw a lot of them fail at their employer where they worked together.</h3>

<h4 id="but-how-were-they-going-to-do-this">But how were they going to do this?</h4>

<p>They knew that these projects failed because the solutions delivered weren’t adopted, but what experience also taught them was that although organisations may be different, their needs from e.g. an intranet (our first solution), were about 80% the same. The customers would then require some customisation to make it feel their own.</p>

<p>So hence was born our agile 80/20 methodology. The first solution accelerator delivered was our flagship intranet – Hadron. It came 80% pre-built (out-of-the-box) and 20% customisable.  And this 80/20 methodology still holds true to this day.</p>

<p>Taran and Simon don’t have technical backgrounds yet are passionate about delivering business solutions to our clients that improve outcomes and make a difference - fast. In fact, the fastest they’ve delivered a SharePoint project is six weeks.</p>

<div id="principles" class="accordion-wrap cf">
<h2>Our Business principles</h2>
<div class="accordion">



	<h3>We are motivated to make a difference to our clients and our sector</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We do it because we want them to succeed and believe in them. We don’t allow projects to fail.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We will always be frank, honest and direct with staff, clients and partners, and ourselves; even if it means turning work away. We want to enable our clients to be self-supporting rather than reliant on us - and come back to us because we help them rather than lock them in.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We believe in Pay It Forward</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We will help people and organisations because we can and we trust it will benefit us in due course.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We take great pride in the professional quality of our work.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake. Though we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to a client's problems. We pride ourselves on having pioneered many new and effective practices and techniques.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>The dedication of our people to the company and the effort they give their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organisations.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We believe in what we do and think that this is an important part of our success. Individually, we own our problems and take responsibility for creating solutions. If we can fix it we will, seeking help where needed.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the agility we know is essential to doing what we do successfully.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>We know that our world will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>We regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships.</h3>
	<div class="accordion-content">
	<p>To breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly or carelessly would be unthinkable.</p>
