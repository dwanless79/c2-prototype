We couple our deep understanding of our customers' markets and a passion for their success, we get them going in weeks not years.

- title: We take great pride in the professional quality of our work.

  text: We believe in what we do and think that this is an important part of our success. Individually, we own our problems and take responsibility for creating solutions. If we can fix it we will, seeking help where needed. 
- title: We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve.
  text: We want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the agility we know is essential to doing what we do successfully.
- title: We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs.
  text: We know that our world will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction.
- title: We regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships.
  text: To breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly or carelessly would be unthinkable.

Admittedly, it’s a mouthful. But all it really means is we work with you to ensure the digital solutions (or, as we call them, digital workspaces) you roll out are 

* thought through
* introduced smoothly
* adopted by staff
* and deliver a substantial ROI

We have a vision to be the leading enabler in digital transformation. And, by supporting you through every step of the digital transformation process, we’re confident we’ll achieve our goal.

### Taran and Simon founded Cloud2 on one simple premise: to stop SharePoint projects failing (because quite frankly—and unfortunately—almost 60% of them do). And they saw a lot of them fail at their employer where they worked together.

#### But how were they going to do this? 

They knew that these projects failed because the solutions delivered weren't adopted, but what experience also taught them was that although organisations may be different, their needs from e.g. an intranet (our first solution), were about 80% the same. The customers would then require some customisation to make it feel their own. 

So hence was born our agile 80/20 methodology. The first solution accelerator delivered was our flagship intranet – Hadron. It came 80% pre-built (out-of-the-box) and 20% customisable.  And this 80/20 methodology still holds true to this day. 

Taran and Simon don’t have technical backgrounds yet are passionate about delivering business solutions to our clients that improve outcomes and make a difference - fast. In fact, the fastest they've delivered a SharePoint project is six weeks.
