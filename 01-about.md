## Meet the directors.

### Taran and Simon founded Cloud2 on one simple premise: to stop SharePoint projects failing (because quite frankly—and unfortunately—almost 60% of them do). And they saw a lot of them fail at their employer where they worked together.

#### But how were they going to do this? 

They knew that these projects failed because the solutions delivered weren't adopted, but what experience also taught them was that although organisations may be different, their needs from e.g. an intranet (our first solution), were about 80% the same. The customers would then require some customisation to make it feel their own. 

So hence was born our agile 80/20 methodology. The first solution accelerator delivered was our flagship intranet – Hadron.  It came 80% pre-built (out-of-the-box) and 20% customisable.  And this 80/20 methodology still holds true to this day. 

Taran and Simon don’t have technical backgrounds yet are passionate about delivering business solutions to our clients that improve outcomes and make a difference - fast. In fact, the fastest they've delivered a SharePoint project is six weeks.

## We work with the best.

### We work with amazing partners to deliver the best in class digital transformation accelerator solutions to our customers.

Our partners are an extension of us and are leaders in their fields. These qualities ensure that we give our customers what they want, on time and on budget.
