summary: Before switching to Hadron 8020, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust were reliant on a dated intranet that required improvement and slowed staff down. Now, staff have access to the information they need at the touch of a button.

When Martin Dowler first heard CWP directors were considering  upgrading their intranet, it was music to his ears.

As Knowledge Manager at Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS  Foundation Trust, Martin is responsible for ensuring clinicians  have access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively. And with a clunky and dated intranet, that’s not always so easy:

“We initially had SharePoint 2007, just out of the box,” Martin recalls. “And limited in-house development resource - not enough to develop and configure a new interface - we had a dated system that hadn’t been updated for nearly eight years.”

And that meant that getting the right information to the right staff at the right time was becoming increasingly challenging.

> Every day, we need to make sure staff across our footprint are updated with correct processes, procedures and care guidelines for a wide range of conditions. Ensuring people have consistent information without sending a barrage of emails isn’t easy.

Staff are rightly focused on patient care and they don’t have the time or the intranet design experience needed to use complex systems.

## A geographically dispersed organisation in need

CWP provides mental health, learning disability, physical health and substance misuse services - but from more than 66 physical locations. To ensure a uniform service, thousands of geographically dispersed staff members all need to be continuously reading from the same page.
