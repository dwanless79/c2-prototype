* Migrate existing IT infrastructure to the Cloud
* Introduce Office 365
* Introduce Azure, the Microsoft Cloud
* Give staff the freedom to work from anywhere
* Keep your organisation secure
* Keep software and systems automatically up to date
* Realise a measurable ROI

The licenses, storage, security and constant upgrades your existing IT infrastructure requires all cost money – and that’s the money that moving to the Cloud saves. That, alongside giving staff freedom to work from anywhere, is why more and more organisations are moving to the Cloud. What would be the return for your organisation?

That’s what Cloud2 help you calculate – and what other organsations sometimes fail to focus on. It’s not hard to see why.

Cloud computing has traditionally been viewed as an end in itself. Ultimately, though, it’s a means to decreased costs and increased productivities.

So Cloud2 work with you at three stages: strategy, implementation and adoption. We make sure migrating to the Cloud isn’t just a tick-box exercise. 

Instead, we can facilitate value discovery workshops and help develop a business case. We can develop proof of concepts and devise real ROI calculations. We can move your systems over without downtime. And we can ensure staff adopt your new way of working. 

So you get all the benefits of migrating to the Cloud without any of the risks.

## Improve productivity by migrating to Office 365

* Microsoft Office hosted in the Cloud
* Allows staff to work from anywhere, on any device
* Access to the latest version of Office, always
* Constant security updates
* No initial capital outlay

Moving staff to Office 365 is simple enough.

Maximising the return on an Office 365 investment is another thing entirely.

_Cloud2 can help with the latter.__

Unlike some organisations, we’re not so keen on simply ticking boxes. Instead, we can help with your Office 365 strategy and its adoption, as well as physical implementation. 

We help you with every stage of the process, ensuring all holes are plugged. 

Armed with the right strategy, technical know-how and experience, there’s little to prevent your switch from going smoothly. 

So your staff are delighted with the move, as opposed to disgruntled.
