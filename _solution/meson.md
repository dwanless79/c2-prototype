home-intro: When different people need access to different reports and data, Power BI and Meson offer relevant, timely information. So your analytics team can focus on uncovering meaningful insights.
home-quote: Meson takes away the need for very basic reports. The finance guys can now get their reports in five minutes rather than in two days, allowing my team to focus on more complex analytics, such as predictive analytics, rather than telling the organisation what it's just done.  And because everyone just ends up discussing live reports online, it’s even helping us towards our paperless targets.

BI teams are one of an organisation’s greatest assets. But not when their days are spent drawing up basic reports.

Power BI makes data visual, intuitive and self-serve, so all departments have access to the data they need. Staff can monitor their own performance and adjust their efforts accordingly, so your BI team can focus on uncovering insights that drive progress.

Cloud2 help you introduce Power BI without teething problems or hiccups. By supporting your Power BI strategy, implementation and adoption, we point out opportunities, dangers and pitfalls, constantly remaining focused on your ROI.

Combining Power BI with Hadron, for example, could immediately highlight, address and resolve increasing absenteeism. Introducing predictive analytics could draw on historical data to predict the future – with surprising accuracy.

Cloud2 help you introduce Power BI to ensure your colleagues have access to the information they need, so BI teams can focus on the reports that will shape your organisation’s future.
