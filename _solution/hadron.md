home-quote: In the end it took just eight weeks from deployment to launch – I couldn't believe how quick the turnaround was. Before Hadron, just 10% of people were ‘completely satisfied’ with our intranet. A year on, we’re at 96%. We have a clear communication structure and the intranet has become part of the language and culture of the Trust.

As you might be aware, over half of all SharePoint projects fail. So is shouting about an intranet that can be up and running in 8 weeks – and tick every box you need it to – a terrible idea?

We don’t think so. Because Hadron is built on SharePoint, so it’s technically a minimal-configuration, low-cost, out-of-the-box intranet.

But it’s customised for your organisation. You let us know what you need; we turn the dials.

So you ensure your colleagues can find the people and documents they need to do their jobs properly, with a design and navigation that’s clean and simple.

And, because we support you with your strategy, implementation and adoption, your staff get an intranet that does everything they need it to. Even when you’re unsure of exactly what that might be.

Your organisation is unique. To see if Hadron meets your specific requirements (and to see it in action) request a free demonstration now. We’ll arrange a convenient time to show you how it works and what it looks like. (We actually quite enjoy talking about intranets and technology.)

## Introducing Connect. A unique employee engagement hub.

* Find individual employees instantly
* Locate departments and teams
* Research locations, premises and facilities

### Cloud2’s employee engagement hub, Connect, is a progression on traditional staff directories.

With Connect, your staff have the knowledge they need to work more efficiently. Over and above colleague contact details, Connect stores information on teams and premises. When combined with Hadron, searching “new starter” (for example) returns all the people, policies and procedures staff might need when hiring new employees. Searching a location returns contact details, key people, facilities and useful facts.

Connect can be standalone or built into Hadron. Quite simply, it makes your workforce more efficient and your colleagues’ lives easy.

### Business processes. Keep everyone on the same page.

* Reduce human error
* Hit paperless targets
* Minimise storage costs
* Improve record keeping
* Increase efficiency

The inefficiencies of paper-based processes might be well-known, but that doesn’t make them any less frustrating. Aside from slowing organisations down, they leave staff dispirited.

Research suggests 83% of workers feel hampered by outdated ways of working. And cumbersome, paper-based processes increase the potential for human error.

Interactive, electronic business processes are different. They guide staff through common procedures – such as procurement or diagnoses. They tackle all the problems associated with paper-based processes at once, and you can introduce them as part of Hadron or as a standalone feature.
