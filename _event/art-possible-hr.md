summary: A FREE NHS workshops over to help you with your digital transformation, Cost Improvement Plans (CIP) and Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs).
audience: Created for HR teams, directors and managers to highlight how they can use automated workflow processes to meet their appraisal and nurse re-validation targets. We've pre-built appraisal and nurse re-validation processes with real time, interactive reporting dashboards for a number of NHS trusts and automated HR processes so they can drive workforce efficiencies faster.
